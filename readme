What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.
None.

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?
Was much better than last time since I knew how to use armlab and my 
home terminal better. After getting over that hump, this assignment Was
much more helpful in understanding how the string module works at the
computer level. It was decently fun, but it's still a coding assignment,
so there's an upper limit there. Still, I'd say it was infinitely more
enjoyable than last time.

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.
It is currently not possible for my implementation of the string 
module for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify that the
destination memory area specified by the caller is large enough. This 
is because the implementation of the function input of the destination 
buffer (pcDest) within these two functions does not allow the program to 
check if the buffer is large enough to hold the result. When we pass in 
pcDest as an array (which decays to a pointer) or a direct pointer, C 
does not have any information about the memory's size that the pointer 
points to, as it loses all information of this. To solve this 
issue, we would need to add a function input to manually pass in the 
destination size in order to assert.
